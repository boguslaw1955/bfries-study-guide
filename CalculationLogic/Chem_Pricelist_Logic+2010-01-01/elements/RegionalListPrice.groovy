/**
 * User Story:
 * - As a Pricing Manager, I  want to calculate the Regional List Price.
 *
 * Acceptance Criteria / Implementation Details:
 * - the RegionalListPrice == GlobalListPrice + RegionalAdj
 * - if the value could not be calculated, the user must be warned and this elements return null
 * - the value is calculated and formatted in the currency found previously in the Price Parameter table "RegionInfo"
 * - the Regional List Price value is rounded to 2 decimal numbers (using the libs.MathLib.RoundingUtils)
