/**
 * User Story:
 * - As a Pricing Manager, I  want to calculate the Global List Price.
 *
 * Acceptance Criteria / Implementation Details:
 * - value of GlobalListPrice (money) == Product Cost (money)  +  MarginAdj (money)
 * - the GlobalListPrice must be calculated and formatted in the the same currency, as the ProductCost
 * - if the value (or currency symbol) are not available or not possible to calculate, the user must be warned.
 * - If no Global List Price is calculated, null is returned
