/**
 * User Story:
 * - As a Pricing Manager, I  want the GlobalListPrice be in the same currency as the Cost of the Product.
 *
 * Acceptance Criteria / Implementation Details:
 * - we need to retrieve the currency from the record retrieved from the Product Extension with product Costs.
 * - we will use the record read in the previous element, instead of reading the record again.
 * - as the currency symbol is used in the Suffix of subsequent elements, it should not return NULL, but rather an empty string.
