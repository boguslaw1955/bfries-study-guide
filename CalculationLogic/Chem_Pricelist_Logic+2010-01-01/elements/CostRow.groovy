/**
 * User Story:
 * - As a Pricing Manager, I  want to calculate the GlobalListPrice based on the Cost of the product.
 *
 * Acceptance Criteria / Implementation Details:
 * - the cost of the products is in the Product Extension table "Chem_ProductCost"
 * - this element returns one whole record from the product extension table, which is valid for the product being calculated.
 *   The values stored in the record (the money amount and currency) will be used in the subsequent elements.
