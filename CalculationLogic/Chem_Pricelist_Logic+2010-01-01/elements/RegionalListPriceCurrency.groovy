/**
 * User Story:
 * - As a Pricing Manager, I  want to calculate the Regional List Price.
 *
 * Acceptance Criteria / Implementation Details:
 * - the currency symbol used for calculation of Regional List Price is provided by the Price Manager in the Price Parameter table "RegionInfo"
 * - as the currency symbol is used in the Suffix of subsequent elements, it should not return NULL, but rather an empty string.
 * - if you cannot find the Currency, because Region was not specified, warn the user.
