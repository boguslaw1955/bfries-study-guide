/**
 * User Story:
 * - As a Pricing Manager, I can see which country the prices are for in the price lists.
 *
 * Acceptance Criteria / Implementation Details:
 *  - This element returns the country name associated with the input "CountryCode".
 *  - If the lookup fails, a warning is added and null is returned.
 *  - The mapping between CountryCode -> CountryName is given by the price parameter
 *      "CountryInfo".
 *  - The Country Name must be available as a price list column.
