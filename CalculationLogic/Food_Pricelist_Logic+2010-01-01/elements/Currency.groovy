/**
 * User Story:
 * - As a Pricing Manager, I can see all the price amounts in the Pricelist to
 *      be calculated in the currency which is used in the country (selected by
 *      the Pricing Manager during the Pricelist creation).
 *
 * Acceptance Criteria / Implementation Details:
 *  - This element returns the currency associated with the input "CountryCode".
 *  - If the lookup fails, a warning is added and null is returned.
 *  - The Currency is used as a Dynamic Currency for the Price list.
 *  - The mapping between CountryCode -> Currency is given by the price parameter "CountryInfo".
