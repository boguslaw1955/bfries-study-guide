/**
 * As a pricing manager, I need to be able to calculate the total raw material cost
 *  of producing a product.
 *
 * Acceptance Criteria / Implementation Details:
 *  - Returns a list of all raw materials that the product is made up of, and the
 *      quantities of each raw material.
 *  - A product can be made up of a mix of raw materials and sub-components.
 *      A sub-component can also be made up of a mix of raw materials and
 *      sub-components. Thus, to calculate the total quantity of all raw materials,
 *      the tree of sub-components needs to be traversed recursively.
 *  - The raw material names and quantities can be accessed in other elements as follows:
 *          - out.RawMaterials[i].rawMaterial (The name of the raw material)
 *          - out.RawMaterials[i].quantity
