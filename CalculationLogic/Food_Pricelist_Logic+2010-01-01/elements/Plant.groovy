/**
 * User Story:
 * - As a Pricing Manager, I can see which plant the products are going to be
 *      manufactured at.
 *
 * Acceptance Criteria / Implementation Details:
 *  - This element returns the plant associated with the region.
 *  - If the lookup fails, a warning is added and null is returned.
 *  - The mapping between Region -> Plant is given by the price parameter
 *      "RegionInfo".
 *  - The Plant Name must be available as a price list column.
