/**
 * User Story:
 * - As a Sales Manager, I need to be able to visually compare the performance of the Quotes issued to
 *     the "individuals" (i.e. physical persons) versus "others" (i.e. the companies)
 *
 * Acceptance Criteria / Implementation Details:
 * - This element calculates grand Total Sales of the transactions
 *      - sales data are available in the Datamart "Drinks_PriceRecord"
 *      - for performance (size of sales) we use summary of column "InvoicePrice" (for all the Invoice Amount from the transaction)
 *      - we're using only data rows limited by filter values entered by the user
 * - This element returns the money amount of grand total sales
