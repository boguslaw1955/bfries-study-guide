/**
 * User Story:
 * - As a Sales Manager, I need to be able to filter the PriceRecord data in the
 *      dashboard according to which salesperson made the deal.
 *
 * Acceptance Criteria / Implementation Details:
 * - This element does two things:
 *      1) If executed in Syntax check mode:
 *          - Creates an optional input parameter which only allows the end-user
 *              to provide usernames which exists in the Data Source "Drinks_PriceRecord".
 *      2) If executed in non-syntax check mode:
 *          - returns the selected username.
