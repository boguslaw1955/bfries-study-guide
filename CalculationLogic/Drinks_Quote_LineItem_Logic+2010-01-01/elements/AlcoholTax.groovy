/**
 * User Story:
 * As a Sales Manager, I need to apply special tax to all alcoholic drinks, to be compliant with state laws.
 *
 * Acceptance Criteria / Implementation Details:
 * - this element calculates and displays the Tax money amount applied on the quote line item.
 * - to have the flexibility, the tax will be calculated only, when the Sales Rep checks the "IncludeTaxes" input checkbox on the Quote header.
 * - the value is calculated and formatted as Money in EUR currency
 * - AlcoholTax = AlcoholTaxRate * Volume
 *
