/**
 * User Story:
 * As a Sales Rep, I need to see the VAT money amount (per unit) on each quote line item.
 *
 * Acceptance Criteria / Implementation Details:
 * - this element calculates and displays the VAT money amount ("VatAbs"), and formats as money in EUR currency
 * - the VAT will be used only, when the Sales Rep checks the "IncludeTaxes" input checkbox on the Quote header.
 * - VatAbs = VatRate * InvoicePrice
 */

// Skip if taxes should not be calculated, according to header input
