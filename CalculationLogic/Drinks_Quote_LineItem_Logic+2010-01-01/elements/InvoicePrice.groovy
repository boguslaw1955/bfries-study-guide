/**
 * User Story:
 * As a Sales Rep, I need to see the Invoice Price (per unit) negotiated with the customer.
 * The initial price is coming from the pricelist, and the SalesRep is able to enter different value during negotiation.
 *
 * Acceptance Criteria / Implementation Details:
 * - This element calculates and displays the Invoice Price per unit
 * - The result is formatted as Money in EUR currency
 * - InvoicePrice = value entered by the Sales Rep in the input field "InvoicePrice" (i.e. the user overrides the pricelist value)
 *                = if the input field value is not provided, use the price calculated in the pricelist "Drinks_Strategy_Pricelist"
