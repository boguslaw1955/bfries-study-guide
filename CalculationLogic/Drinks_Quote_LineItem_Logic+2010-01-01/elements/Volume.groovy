/**
 * User Story:
 * As a Sales Rep, I need to see on each quote line the Volume (in Litres) of the product.
 *
 * Acceptance Criteria / Implementation Details:
 * - this element calculates and returns the Volume of the product (in Litres).
 * - Note about the units:    1000 l == 1 m3          1 kg == 1000 g
 * - the result should have suffix "l"
 * - Volume == Weight / Density
 * - Product's Weight is available for each product (in grams) in the Product Master table
 * - Density = we use simplified Water density here, i.e.  1 kg / 1 litre
