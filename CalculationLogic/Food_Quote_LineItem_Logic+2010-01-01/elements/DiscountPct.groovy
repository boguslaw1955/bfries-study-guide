/**
 * User Story:
 *  - As a Sales Person I can see the % amount of discount provided to the customer.
 *
 * Acceptance Criteria / Implementation Details:
 *  - This element calculates and returns the Sales Discount %.
 *      SalesDiscountPct = Discount / ListPrice
 *  - If the Discount cannot be calculated, a warning is added.
 *  - When both Requested Price and Sales Discount are entered, a warning is added,
 *      since the Sales Discount % input will have been ignored in the element
 *      "InvoicePriceAndSalesDiscount".
