/**
 * User Story:
 *  - As a Sales Person, I can select the customer for the Quote, so that I get correct results based on the specific customer.
 *
 * Acceptance Criteria / Implementation Details:
 *  -  This element returns the Customer Id from the Header input. The Customer Id
 *      is entered only once on the Quote Header, but used across all line items.
 *  - An input for the customer Id must not appear on the line item level.
