/**
 * User Story:
 *  - As a Sales Person I can see the average cost of producing the product
 *      directly in the quote.
 *
 * Acceptance Criteria / Implementation Details:
 *  - This element retrieves the average cost of producing the product.
 *  - The average costs are located Product Extenstion table "Food_ProductCost".
 *  - The element should retrieve the most up-to-date entry that is also older
 *      than the effective date.
 *  - The amount must be converted to the quote's currency, if necessary.
 *  - If the cost cannot be retrieved/converted, a warning is added.
