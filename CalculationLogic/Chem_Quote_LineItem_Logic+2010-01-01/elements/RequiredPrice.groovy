/**
 * User Story:
 * As a Sales Rep, I want to be able to enter the price required by (negotiated with) the customer, so that I can override
 * the Invoice Price which was calculated automatically.
 *
 * Acceptance Criteria / Implementation Details:
 *  - the RequiredPrice is a decimal number
 *  - the RequiredPrice is optional
 *  - the RequiredPrice is expected to be entered in the customer's currency
 *  - the name of the input parameter is "RequiredPrice"
 *  - the label of the input parameter is "Required Price (per unit)"
 *
 * - This element does two things:
 *      1) If executed in Syntax check mode:
 *          - Creates a optional input parameter of numeric type.

 *      2) If executed in non-syntax check mode:
 *          - returns the input value.
