/**
 * User Story
 * As a Sales Manager, I want to see the invoice price "suggested" (calculated) by the system, which is calculated as ListPrice - StandardDiscount%
 *
 * Acceptance Criteria / Implementation Details:
 * - SuggestedPrice = ListPrice * (1 - StandardDiscountPct)
 * - If the Standard Discount is not negotiated with the customer, we use 0% for it's value
