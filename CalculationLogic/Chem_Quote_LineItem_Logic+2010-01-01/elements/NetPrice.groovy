/**
 * User Story:
 * As a Sales Manager, I'd like to see the NetPrice, which is a price without any discounts.
 *
 * Acceptance Criteria / Implementation Details:
 * - this element returns the money value of the NetPrice in customer currency
 * - NetPrice = InvoicePrice * (1 - CashDiscount%)
 * - CashDiscount% might not be available for the Customer. In that case use 0% for its value.
