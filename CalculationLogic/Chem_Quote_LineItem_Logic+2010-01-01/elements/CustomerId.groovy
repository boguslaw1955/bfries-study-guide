/**
 * User Story
 * As a Sales Rep, I need to select a customer on the Quote Header (i.e. only once for the whole quote),
 * because the product calculations depends on the customer selected.
 *
 * Acceptance Criteria / Implementation Details:
 * - This element returns the ID of the customer selected on the Quote Header in the input parameter "Customer"
 * - during testing of the quote line item logic, we need to be able to specify the customerId,
 *     even if the header information is not available during test.
