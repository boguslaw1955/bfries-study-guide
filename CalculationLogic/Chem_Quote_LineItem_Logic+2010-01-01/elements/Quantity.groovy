/**
 * User Story:
 * As a Sales Representative, I need to be able to specify the Quantity of the product.
 *
 * Acceptance Criteria / Implementation Details:
 *  - the Quantity is a decimal number
 *  - the Quantity is Required - without Quantity we'd not be able to provide several important results
 *  - the name of the input parameter is "Quantity"
 *
 * - This element does two things:
 *      1) If executed in Syntax check mode:
 *          - Creates a REQUIRED (non-optional) input parameter of numeric type.

 *      2) If executed in non-syntax check mode:
 *          - Raises a warning if the input value has not been provided.
 *          - returns the input value.
