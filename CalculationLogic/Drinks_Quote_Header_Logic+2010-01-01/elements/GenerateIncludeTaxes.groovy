/**
 * User Story:
 *  As a Sales Person, I want to specify, if the prices calculated on the line items across the Quote, should contain Taxes or not.
 *
 * Acceptance Criteria / Implementation Details:
 * - This element creates an checkbox input field on a Quote Header, named "IncludeTaxes".
 *       - by default, it will be blank / un-checked.
 *       - The input is not required
