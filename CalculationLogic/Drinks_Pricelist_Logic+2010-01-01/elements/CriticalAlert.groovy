/**
 * User Stories:
 * - As a Pricing Manager, I want to be alerted, when the Gross Margin is above defined thresholds.
 *
 * Acceptance Criteria / Implementation Details:
 * - this element returns the Critical threshold value, which will be used as threshold for Gross Margin
 * - the threshold value is defined by Pricing Manager in the Price Parameter table "PriceStrategy"
 * - if the Gross Margin crosses this threshold, then this result value should have red/critical (unless overridden by higher Alert)
