/**
 * User Stories:
 * - As a Pricing Manager, I need to have the Gross Margin calculated, to give me first impression of profitability.
 * - As a Pricing Manager, I want to be alerted, when the Gross Margin is above defined thresholds.
 *
 * Acceptance Criteria / Implementation Details:
 * - this element returns the Gross Margin % value, formatted as percentage
 * -  GrossMargin% = (ListPrice - Cost) / ListPrice
 * - if the Gross Margin crosses the Thresholds defined in Price Parameter table "PriceStrategy", then this result value
 *            must have an appropriate Alert on it
