/**
 * User Story:
 * As a Pricing Manager, I want to calculate the CostPlus price, to be used either as ListPrice or as a reference.
 *
 * Acceptance Criteria / Implementation Details:
 * - This element returns the Cost Plus price, caclulated in the pricelist currency
 * - CostPlusPrice = Cost * ( 1 + ( MarginAdjPct / (1 - MarginAdjPct) ) )
 * - MarginAdjPct - is provided by the Pricing Manager in the Price Parameter table "MarginAdjPct". The value depends on the "ProductGroup" attribute of the product.
