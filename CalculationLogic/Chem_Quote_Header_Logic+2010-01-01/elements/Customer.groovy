/**
 * User Story:
 * As a Sales Rep, I need to be able to enter the Customer, with who I negotiate the quote,
 * because it will influence all the quote calculations.
 *
 * Acceptance Criteria / Implementation Details:
 * - the Customer input parameter must be mandatory, because many results depend on it
 * - Customer input is provided by the system on the Quote header by default
 *   (Administration > Configuration > QuoteConfigurator General Settings > Add customer input to root item automatically)
 * - Customer input field is named "Customer"
